            <li>6 chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise (butterflied)  </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste  </li>
            <li>Â¾ cup all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika </li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten  </li>
            <li>2 cups seasoned bread crumbs  </li>
            <li>1 large lemon, zested </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
                Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil over foil. Place baking sheet in preheated oven.</li>
            <li>Flatten chicken breasts so they are all about 1/4-inch thick. Season chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix flour and paprika together on a large plate. Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. 
                Mix bread crumbs and lemon zest together on a separate large plate. Dredge each chicken piece in flour mixture, 
                then egg, and then bread crumbs mixture and set aside in 1 layer on a clean plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
            <li>Remove baking sheet from oven and arrange chicken in 1 layer on the sheet. Drizzle more olive oil over each piece of coated chicken.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue baking until no longer pink in the center and the breading is lightly browned, 
                5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
